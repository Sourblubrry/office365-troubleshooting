## OneDrive Not Syncing

### Steps to Resolve

1. **Restart OneDrive**: Sometimes a simple restart can fix sync issues.
   - Right-click the OneDrive icon in the system tray and select Close OneDrive.
   - Restart OneDrive from the Start menu.

2. **Check File Path Length**: Ensure file paths do not exceed 255 characters.

4. **Check Storage Space**: Ensure you have enough storage space in OneDrive.
   - Free up space or purchase additional storage if needed.
